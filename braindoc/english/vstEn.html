As already mentioned on the start-page, I develop VST-PlugIns. VST is an abbreviation of
Virtual Studio Technology. This is an open standard for different kinds of audio plugIns.
The VST-standard was created by the audiosofware-company Steinberg
(<a href="http://www.steinberg.de" target="_blank">www.steinberg.de</a>) and provides an 
interface for programming audio-effects and software-instruments in an easy way (thanks Steinberg!)
Many of my plugIn-creations are downloadable as freeware here on this page. I always appreciate 
feedback such as suggestions for improvements, new ideas and bug-reports. All of the plugIns
published here are done to the best of my knowledge and in all conscience and have been tested. 
However, it is never possible to be sure that everything is 100 percent bug-free. For this reason 
I cannot assume responsibility for any damages that may occur on your system because of the use 
of these plugIns. At the moment, my plugIns are only available for the PC-platform, because I
don't have a Mac to compile Mac-versions. The plugIns come in the form of .zip-archives which
include a .dll file and some also include some presets in the .fxp format. Simply download the .zip, unzip and copy or move the .dll file into the VST-plugIn folder. The user manuals are provided here on this page as .html files.

 <A HREF="../vst/Aggressor.zip"><b>Aggressor</b></A>
 <br>
Aggressor is a monophonic synthesizer, which can be used as a VST instrument. The synth was specifically designed to produce aggressive bass- and lead-sounds where special attention was paid on the ability to authentically emulate the typical sound of the famous TB-303. The architecture is based on the classic VCO-VCF-VCA structure where each of the building blocks goes far beyond the typical implementation of bassline synths.  <a href="../manuals/AggressorEn.html" target="_self">read the manual...</a>  

<!-- <p>
Aggressor is still in development will be released as commercial VSTi (hopefully soon). However, even the free demo version will provide more features than most other bass/lead synths do.  -->

<p>
I started a thread at kvraudio about this synth: here it is:

 <A HREF="../vst/ChannelTool.zip"><b>Channel-Tool</b></A>
 <br>
 Channel-Tool is a quite simple plugIn with which you can adjust the gain, the stereo-mix and the
 phase of the input signal. Actually I did program this plugIn mainly for myself as a template
 or skeleton plugIn - which means a plugIn I use as a starting point for the development of
 other plugIns. Nevertheless, in practice it is sometimes quite useful. Because of its simplicity
 I did not include a manual.

 <A HREF="../vst/StereoDelay.zip"><b>Stereo-Delay</b></A>
 <br>
 Stereo-Delay is a plugIn for the creation of delay- and echo-effects. It provides two independent
 delay-lines for the left and the right channel. The delaylines have a feedback-loop with 
 highpass- and lowpass-filter and can also interact via crossfeedback. The delay-times are not
 specified in seconds or milliseconds, but musically as a note-value.

 <A HREF="../vst/PitchShifter_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Pitch-Shifter</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
 <br>
 Pitch-Shifter is a plugIn for shifting the pitch of the input signal without affecting the
 overall length. Normally pitch and length of audio material are coupled - if you simply 
 icrease the playback-tempo, the pitch raises and the length shortens. Pitch-Shifter uses
 a delayline-based granular algorithm to decouple the pitch from the length, so that the overall
 length of the signal will not be affected (which would not make much sense in a realtime-plugIn anyway)

 <A HREF="../vst/ShifterBank_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Shifter-Bank</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
 <br>
 Shifter-Bank is a plugIn for the creation of several pitch-shifted versions of the input signal.
 With low shift-factors (in the range between a few cents and a semitone) you will get effects
 which are called "unison" in some synthsizers (indeed was it a discussion about unison in the forum
 on <a href="http://www.kvraudio.com" target=blank>www.kvraudio.com</a>, which motivated this 
 plugIn). The plugIn can therefore be used to create a "fatter" sound. With higher amounts of
 pitch-shifting, the effects remind me on effects used on TV to garble voices of persons who
 want to stay anonymous. This plugIn - the same as the Pitch-Shifter - works with a delayline-based
 granulation algorithm.

 <A HREF="../vst/LPCVocoder_v1.0.0.zip"><b>LPC-Vocoder</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
 <br>
 LPC-Vocoder is a plugIn for the creation of vocoder-sounds. These are created by superimposing
 the frequency-envelope of one signal (the so called analysis- or modulatorsignal) on a second
 signal (the so called synthesis- or carriersignal). In the classic vocoder this is achieved
 by means of an analysis- and a synthesis-filterbank - the LPC-Vocoder in contrast uses a single
 adaptive filter which is capable of realizing complex frequency-responses with many peaks.
 LPC is an abbriviation of Linear Predictive Coding - a technique in signal processing which
 can extract the formants (frequency bands with high amplitude) out of an audio signal. LPC is
 widely used in the speech signal processing community, for example to compress the speech
 for transmission in digital communication systems.

 <A HREF="../vst/Compressor_v1.0.1.zip"><b>Compressor</b></A> (version 1.0.1)
 <br>
 Compressor is a plugIn for the reduction of the dynamics of an input signal. Compressors achieve
 this goal by analyzing the amplitude envelope of the incoming signal and reducing the gain when the
 signal exceeds a certain threshold. This reduces the amplitude of the peaks in the audio signal.
 Now the signal can be amplified further without clipping/distortion. So at the end of the day we
 have a signal in which the loud parts stay as they are and the quiet parts are amplified. This 
 increases the overall loudness of the signal.

 <A HREF="../vst/TranceGate_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Trance-Gate</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
 <br>
 Trance-Gate is a plugIn for the creation of gate effects. The opening and closing of the gate is
 triggered by incoming MIDI-notes - note on events trigger the opening phase, note-off events trigger
 the closing phase. As opposed to gates with a built in step sequencer this has two advantages: first,
 it gives the user more flexibility in the rhythmic opening and closing because the user can take full
 advantage of all MIDI functions which the chosen sequencer software provides (different note-lengths
 for each step, changing rythms, etc.). And second: the plugIn is small and does not take much space
 on the monitor. ...and it did not take much time to implement it :-).

<p>
 <A HREF="../vst/AutoPan_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Auto-Pan</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
 <br>
Auto-Pan is a VST-plugIn for the automatic adjustment of the panorama position of the signal (where "automatic" means LFO-controlled in this case). The LFO is tempo-synchronized and can be triggered either via the graphical user inface or via note-on events.

<A HREF="../vst/EnvelopeDesigner_v1.0.1.zip"><b>Envelope-Designer</b></A> (Version 1.0.1)
<br>
Envelope-Designer is a plugIn with which you can adjust the realtive amount of the attack transients and the sutained/release components in a signal.

<A HREF="../vst/StereoEnhancer_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Stereo-Enhancer</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
<br>
Stereo-Enhancer is a VST-plugIn for the PC-platform for the modification of stereo-width of a signal. The adjustment can be made for low, mid and high frequencies seperately. The separation of the frequency-bands is achieved by means of linear-phase FIR-filters. This is, because the sum of the three filtered (not yet modified) signals should sum up exactly to the original signal.

<A HREF="../vst/PsychoPhaser_v1.0.0.zip"><b>Psycho-Phaser</b></A> (version 1.0.0)
<br>
Psycho-Phaser is a VST-plugIn for phasing effects. This effect arises, when sending the input signal through a chain of allpass-filters and mixing that filtered signal with the original signal. An allpass-filters lets all frqeuencies pass without any attenuation or amplification, but introduces a frequency-dependent phase-shift. When the filtered signal is mixed with the original signal, there will be notches in the frequency-content of the resulting signal at all frequencies at which the phase-shift in the filtered signal is some odd integer multiple of 180 degrees. In contrast to a flanger, these notches are not distributed at integer multiples of some fundamental frequency along the frequency axis - so they have no harmonic relationship. This is the most distinguishing feature between phasers and flangers (which are often regarded as somehow similar). If the characteristic frequencies of the allpass-filters are modulated over time (via an LFO), these notches slide back and forth on the frequency axis - this is phasing. Psycho-Phaser provides two independent allpass-chains for left and right channel, each of which with its own, tempo-synchronized LFO.

<A HREF="../vst/StereoFlanger_v1.0.1.zip"><b>Stereo-Flanger</b></A> (version 1.0.1)
<br>
Stereo-Flanger is a VST-plugIn for the creation of comb-filter and flanger effects. A comb-filter delays the incoming signal by a certain amount of time and mixes the delayed signal with the original signal. Because of interference between the two signals, there will be peaks and notches in the resulting signal - peaks occur at frequencies, where the original and delayed signal are in phase, notches occur at frequenceis, where the phase bewteen the original and the delayed signal is 180° - at these frequencies, the two signals cancel out each other. The positions of these peaks and notches is determined by the delay-time and they will always have a harmonic relationship - that is: they are all integer multiples of some fundamental frequency. It is also possible to feed back the output of the delayline back to its input - this emphasizes the peaks in the spectrum. When the delaytime is modulated over time (with a LFO, for example), the peaks and notches slide back and forth on the frequncy-axis - this is flanging. Stereo-Flanger provides two LFO-modulated delaylines - one for the left and one for the right channel.
