On this page I will keep you up to date about changes on this site. In particular I will
announce new uploads in the "TRACKS" and "VST" section.

<b>18.01.2006:</b>
 
new freeware-plugIn online: Stereo-Flanger

<p align=left>
<b>23.11.2005:</b> I introduce a version numbering scheme for my plugIns. The first field is the major version number (which changes only when there is such big amount of new features, that we are in effect dealing with an entirely different plugIn - the former major version will still be available in this case), the second field is the minor version number (which changes when there are some new features implemented - the former minor version will be replaced in this case) and the third field is the release number (which changes when some bugs have been fixed, or there are some details changed (for example in the graphical user interface)).

<p align=left>
<b>21.11.2005:</b> A new version of "Compressor" is online. There was a bugfix which fixes the indefinite output-amplitudes for zero input.

<p align=left>
<b>18.11.2005:</b> Stereo-Phaser has been renamed into Psycho-Phaser - that fits better to its psychedelic sound and also to my pseudonym. There is also an english version of the manual now.

<b>14.11.2005:</b> 2 new plugIns online: Stereo-Enhancer and Stereo-Phaser

<p align=left>
<b>03.11.2005:</b> new plugIn online: Envelope-Designer

<p align=left>
<b>02.11.2005:</b> The user manuals for my VST-plugIns will be from now on available as .html files online in the VST-section. For this reason I also decided to not include a .doc-type user manual in the downloadable archives anymore.

<p align=left>
<b>01.11.2005:</b> The archives in the "VST" section now contain also an english user manual.

<p align=left>
