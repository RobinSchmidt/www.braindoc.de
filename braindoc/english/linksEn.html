 Well...sad... the Tresor is history now. At least in it's old location. When, where and 
 how the story will go on, you will get to know here - it's not over! Greets to Rundstutzen - great site!

 The "Ministerium für Enstpannung" which means: "Ministry of Relaxation" in English. 
 A very relaxed club indeed. Nevertheless, the music is asskicking. Goa-Trance!

 <br>
 The K17 club. At the moment the best club for dark-musik in Berlin. In particular regarding
 the concerts. For 10-15 Euro you can get there artists who could easily fill large
 concert-halls.
