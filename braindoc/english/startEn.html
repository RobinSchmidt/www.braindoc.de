<h2>What is this website about?</h2>

<p>
<strong>Music:</strong>
<br>
I produce electronic music, mainly techno and (hard-)trance, sometimes also gabba, chill-out and
since some time also dark-electro. I started roughly in 1994 with "Scream-Tracker", later I migrated
to "Fast-Tracker", then one day I bought the Soundblaster AWE32 and even later the professional 
hardware-synth Roland JX-305. But today I use this synth almost exclusively as MIDI-keyboard, since
today I prefer to work with software-synthies and effects (mostly in the form of VST-PlugIns).

<p>
<strong>Sounddesign and Programming:</strong>
<br>
Not only do I produce music, but I'm also a passionate synthesizer- and effect-freak - this means
I'm interested in sounddesign and all this technical stuff and signal-processing which is involved
there. For this reason one day I started to develop my own VST-PlugIns, many of which you can
download as freeware under the menu-option "VST".

<p>
<strong>Private:</strong>
<br>
My real name is Robin Schmidt, I was born in 1979 and live in Berlin, Germany. If you want to, you
can view some funny party-pictures under the menu-option "PICS" - but this area is obviously more 
intresting to me and my friends than to the public.
