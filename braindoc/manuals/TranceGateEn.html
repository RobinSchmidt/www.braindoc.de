<strong>What is Trance-Gate?:</strong>
<br>
Trance-Gate is a plugIn for the creation of gate effects. The opening and closing of the gate is triggered by incoming MIDI-notes - note-on events trigger the opening phase, note-off events trigger the closing phase. As opposed to gates with a built in step sequencer this has two advantages: first, it gives the user more flexibility in the rhythmic opening and closing because the user can take full advantage of all MIDI functions which the chosen sequencer software provides (different note-lengths for each step, changing rythms, etc.). And second: the plugIn is small and does not take much space on the monitor. ...and it did not take much time to implement it :-).

<strong>Parameters:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gain:</strong>
This is a gain value for the incoming signal. Taken alone, this seems not to make much sense in a gate-plugIn. Within the trance gate, however, this parameter can be made velocity dependent via the attached "Vel" control. You can therefore realize different volumes for the different steps.

<li><strong>Vel:</strong>
see above.

<li><strong>Att:</strong>
Attack time of the gate - this is the time which the gate needs to open after receiving a note-on event.

<li><strong>Vel:</strong>
This attack time can be made velocity dependent, too. Positive values will increase the attack time for velocities > 64 and decrease it for velocities < 64. For negative values, it is the other way around.

<li><strong>Rel:</strong>
Release time of the gate - the time, the gate needs for closing, after a note-off event has been received.

<li><strong>Vel:</strong>
works the same way, as the "Vel"-control for the attack time.

<li><strong>Amt:</strong>
abbreviates amount. This knob therefore controls the overall effect of the gate. In principle, this is somehow a crossfader between the original and the gated signal - just like a Dry/Wet control (although it is implemented differently).
</ul>

<strong>A little hint for practice:</strong>
<br>
When the gate is set to a somewhat higher attack time, it can make sense to give a small negative delay to the driving MIDI-track in order to have a fully opened gate at the relevant note positions instead of having a gate which now starts with its opening phase.

Have much fun in making music, Braindoc.
